# JPA Date Handling (Hibernate)

This is a simple spring-boot app that leverages DBUnit to simulate JPA date extraction - using hibernate as our JPA provider, and sql server as our data store. Example Date handling pitfalls are showcased in the single test file ```DateHandlingTest```. This file can be ran in isolation.

### Build/Run

```
mvn clean install
mvn test
```
